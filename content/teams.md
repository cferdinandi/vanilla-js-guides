## How it works

A team license gives your entire team access to the complete set of pocket guides.

- **Learn Fundamental Skills.** From DOM manipulation basics to advanced app development, your team will learn [a wide range of evergreen topics](#what-your-team-will-learn). 
- **Multiple Learning Formats.** Everyone learns differently. Team licenses include both streaming HD videos with captions, and written lessons in ebook format.
- **Source Code.** Many developers learn best through experimentation. Your team gets the complete source code for all of the lesson and projects.
- **Community Access.** Your team gets exclusive access to my private Slack workspace, where they can chat with other students and ask questions.
